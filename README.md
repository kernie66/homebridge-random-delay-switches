# Homebridge-Random-Delay-Switches

With this plugin, you can create any number of fake switches that will start a timer, which can be a random duration too (between two configured values), when turned ON. When the delay time is reached the switch will automatically turn OFF and trigger a dedicated motion sensor for 3 seconds. This can be very useful for advanced automation with HomeKit scenes - when delayed actions are required.

The random duration is very useful if you want an automation which simulates your presence at home by switching the lights at a random time. This looks more realisitic than a statically configured on/off-time.

By using the minimum delay, you can make sure that there is a delay for at least the minimum time. This is useful for temporary switching on a light, e.g. when a camera or sensor detects motion.

It is also possible to create a stateful switch, with or without the motion sensor, which stays in the current state until commanded to the other state.

*(New in v1.1.0)* The switches can be scheduled to turn on automatically by using a **cron** syntax. The delay will start at the scheduled times, which can be useful to trigger other advanced automations, e.g. to check the state of a sensor during specific times or dates.

*(New in v1.2.0)* Increased the max delay to almost 10 days and added infinite repeats.

*(New in v1.2.1)* Added config parameter to select if config values or user changes will be used when Homebridge restarts for each switch. For convenience, delay and minimum delay can be configured in the format `D:HH:MM:SS` for days, hours, minutes and seconds, or just (a lot of) seconds.

## How to install

* ```sudo npm install -g homebridge-random-delay-switches```
* Create a platform and a delay switch in your config.json file, or use the Homebridge UI
* Restart homebridge

## Example config.json:

 ```
    "platforms": [
      {
        "platform": "RandomDelaySwitches"
        "name": "Randomly",
        "delaySwitches": [
          {
            "name": "RDS-Test",
            "delay": 60,
            "minDelay": 30,
            "random": true,
            "disableSensor": false,
            "startOnReboot": false,
            "repeats": 0
          }
        ]
       }
     ]
```
This gives you a switch which will trigger the motion sensor after a random delay of 30 to 60 seconds.

## Why adding motion sensor?

A motion sensor is created for each accessory in order to be able to cancel the timer and the attached automations.
How it works? You can set the automation to be triggered from the motion sensor instead of the switch OFF command and therefore
you can turn OFF the switch and prevent the motion sensor from being triggered or any attached automations.
If you have no use of the sensor you can remove it by adding `"disableSensor": true` to your config.

## How it works

Basically, all you need to do is:
1. Set the desired delay time in the config file (in seconds).
2. If you want to have a random delay, you can also set the minimum delay.
3. The plugin will create one switch and one motion sensor for this accessory.
4. Use this switch in any scene or automation.
5. Set an automation to trigger when this switch is turned ON or the motion sensor is triggered - The "EVE" app is very recommended to set these kind of automations.

The characteristics of the switch are visible in the Eve app. These characteristics can be updated and used in automation conditions. The updates will be valid until the `Restore default` control is activated. The "Controller for Homekit" app is also a good way of controlling your automations.

### Scheduling with cron

The plugin uses the [cron](https://github.com/kelektiv/node-cron) package for the scheduling. A cron string consists of five or six fields. Six fields are used to schedule down to seconds, and five fields gives control down to minutes. The basic syntax is shown below:
```
 # ┌────────────── second (0-59, optional)
 # │ ┌──────────── minute (0-59)
 # │ │ ┌────────── hour (0-23)
 # │ │ │ ┌──────── day of month (1-31)
 # │ │ │ │ ┌────── month (0-11 or Jan-Dec)
 # │ │ │ │ │ ┌──── day of week (0-6 or Sun-Sat)
 # │ │ │ │ │ │
 # │ │ │ │ │ │
 # * * * * * *
```

A cron string of `* * * * * *` (six fields) will trigger every second, while a cron string of `* * * * *` (five fields) will trigger every minute. Several cron strings can be combined by separating them with a `;` (semicolon), to get different scheduled triggers for a switch. Some examples:
* `*/15 * * * Sat,Sun` will trigger every 15th minute on Saturdays and Sundays
* `30 15 16-19 * */3 *` will trigger 15th minutes and 30 seconds past the hour from 16:15:30 to 19:15:30 every third month
* `5/20 16-19 * * Mon-Fri; 5/20 14-20 * * Sat,Sun` will trigger every 20th minute, starting 5 minutes past the hour between 16:05 and 19:45 on weekdays and between 14:05 and 20:45 on weekends

Read more about the available cron patterns [here](https://github.com/kelektiv/node-cron#available-cron-patterns).

Note that Sunday is weekday 0, so if Sunday is used in a range it must come first.

It is not always so easy to get the cron strings right, and they may not be implemented the same way by different libraries or plugins. The selected [cron](https://github.com/kelektiv/node-cron) package seems to work as intended, but to check that you get the intended schedule please check the Homebridge log. When the cron string is set, the log will include a human readable interpretation of the cron string, as well as the five next scheduled times. The readable interpretation is also shown in the [control values](#control-values), but it is limited to 64 characters.

## Configuration options

The possible configuration parameters are shown in the table below. I find them useful, but maybe I am a control freak :-). The parameters can be changed dynamically in Eve and Controller for HomeKit, see [Control values](#control-values), and will keep the settings when the plugin is restarted.

Parameter | Default | Description
----------|---------|----------------
`delay`   | 60      | (Maximum) delay in seconds, max value = 823999 (9 days, 23:59:59). Can also be given on the format `D:HH:MM:SS`, where D and HH are optional (e.g. 5:00 means 5 minutes = 300 seconds)
`minDelay` | 1      | Minimum delay in seconds or `D:HH:MM:SS`. Only valid when `random` is `true`. Will be set to `delay` if greater than `delay`.
`random`   | `false` | Enables random delays between `minDelay` and `delay` seconds (boolean).
`disableSensor`| `false` | Disables the motion sensor, i.e. only the switch will be available in HomeKit (boolean).
`startOnReboot` | `false` | Enables the delay switch when the plugin is restarted. Can be used e.g. to turn things on after power outage. Hint: Combine with a time of day condition, so your lights don't turn on while you sleep (boolean).
`singleActivation` | `false` | Disables the extension of the timer if the switch is activated repeatedly while on. Default is to restart the delay switch for each activation while on.
`repeats`   | 0      | The number of additional activations of the switch. Can be used to control different lights with several consecutive delays, see below (0 - 10, where 0 gives one activation of the switch, 1 gives two activations and so on). *Legacy, but still supported: Set to -1 for infinite repeats*.
`infiniteRepeats` | `false` | Enables infinite repeats (boolean). This will automatically be set to `true` if `repeats` is set to -1.
`cron`      | Empty | Schedules the switch activation with a cron syntax. Add several schedules by separating the cron strings with ";".
`useConfig` | `true` | Use the values from the config file when Homebridge restarts. Set this to `false` to keep any changes to the parameters made in e.g. Eve or Controller for Homekit when Homebridge restarts.
`heartrate` | 15     | The time in seconds between polls in the plugin, see below.

## Control values

The plugin provides some control values that can be viewed and used in Eve and Controller for HomeKit. The control values can be used in conditions for automations and set in scenes. Each switch can be controlled individually and dynamically through these values, without restarting Homebridge. Note that numerical values in Eve are set using sliders, while Controller for Homekit gives options for manual input.

Value | Description
------|-------------
Last Motion  | The time that the motion sensor was last triggered by the delay switch. Includes a history graph when viewed in Eve.
Cron         | A text field where a new cron string can be entered. Eve remembers the string and is recommended to try out new schedules. Controller for Homekit shows the current string as a placeholder, but you cannot edit an existing string.
Cron schedule | Shows a readable interpretation of the cron string, limited to 64 characters. Use this to check that your cron strings gives the intended schedule.
Current timeout value | The actual delay value used by the switch. Only valid when the switch is On. Shows the calculated random delay or the fixed value.
Delay time (d/h/m/s) | Corresponds to the `delay` parameter, but separated in days,hours, minutes and seconds for better control using Eve sliders.
Delay time minimum (%) | Corresponds to the `minDelay` parameter, but given as a percentage of the maximum time. 0% = 1 second, 100% = `delay`.
Random enabled | Corresponds to the `random` parameter.
Repetition (current) | The current repetition count, only valid when the switch is active. The initial activation of the switch is 0. Can be used in automations to control different lights at different repetition cycles.
Repetitions (total) | Corresponds to the `repeats` parameter. The switch will be turned Off during the motion activation, then turned On again for the number of repetition times.
Infinite repeats | Enable this to get infinite repeats after the first activation.
Restore default | Restores the configuration parameters to the default values from the configuration file.
Time left of timer | The time left before the delay time is up. Decremented by the heartbeat value. Used to continue the delay after a restart, if the delay was active.
Heartrate   | Internal heartbeat rate used e.g. to keep track of the time left of the timer. The heartbeat and the timers are not synced, so the time left may be off by up to the heartrate value. The default value of 15 s is recommended for most cases, unless the delay time is long. Corresponds to the `heartrate` parameter.
Log Level   | Controls the amount of log entries in the Homebridge log. Set to 0 to only show warnings, if you feel your log is spammed. Default = 2.

## Advanced usage

### Change values in scenes

The control values can be changed by scenes using Eve and Controller for Homekit, if you want to use the same switch (e.g. to trigger your lights) but with different parameters for specific conditions. Just create a scene, change the values and turn on the switch. Note that these changes will be set until changed the next time. Text values can only be set in scenes using Controller for Homekit, they are not visible in Eve scenes.

*Hint: You can create a scene that restores the control values to the default configuration, which is triggered by the motion sensor, to ensure that the changes are reset.*

### Stateful switch

A stateful switch can be created by setting the `delay` parameter to 0 s and the `random` parameter to `false`. The switch will trigger the motion sensor (if enabled) each time it is set to on, and will stay on until set to off. Set `singleActivation` to `true` to disable repeated motion sensor trigger when the switch is on.

*Hint: Set `startOnReboot` to `true` to get the switch set to on automatically when the plugin starts.*

## Why do we need this plugin?

The main purpose is to use it with the random feature. This way you can simulate your presence at home by switching lights on and off at
a random time around a configured starting time, e.g. set an automation to start at 7:00 PM, a delay of 1800 seconds and set random to true.
Now the motion switch will be triggered between 7:00 PM and 7:30 PM at a random time.

Other examples are, when using smart wall switch (to turn ON) and RGB light bulb (to switch color) together on the same scene can cause
no action on the bulb since the bulb might not even be ON when the command has been sent from homebridge.
For that, we need to set an automation to change the bulb color a few seconds after the wall switch ON command.

Another example is using this plugin to turn ON/OFF lights based on a motion/door sensor. This can be achieved by setting an automation
to turn ON a light when the delay swich is turned ON and turn OFF the light when the dedicated delay motion sensor is triggered. Use the minimum delay to make sure that the light is turned on long enough, e.g. to have time to unlock the door.

Also it can be use with any device that require a certain delay time from other devices (TV + RPi-Kodi / PC + SSH / etc...)

I also found that I used another plugin to trigger the delay switches by schedules, so I incorporated the cron feature in this plugin to get what I want to use myself.

## Good to know

* **When manually turning OFF the switch, the timer will stop and the motion sensor will NOT be triggered.**

* **When the delay switch is getting ON command while it's already ON, the timer will restart and the motion sensor trigger will be delayed. This can be disabled by the `singleActivation` configuration.**

* **If Homebridge or the plugin is restarted while a switch is active, the switch will continue the delay after the restart. This will override the `startOnReboot` configuration.**

* **If the switch delay is changed while the switch is on, the new delay value will be used the next time the switch is (re)started.**

## Thanks
This plugin is based on [homebridge-random-delay-switch](https://github.com/lisanet/homebridge-random-delay-switch), which in turn is based on [homebridge-delay-switch](https://github.com/nitaybz/homebridge-delay-switch) and [homebridge-automation-switches](https://github.com/grover/homebridge-automation-switches).

My purpose with this plugin was to turn it into a platform plugin by using [Homebridge-Lib](https://github.com/ebaauw/homebridge-lib) by Eric Baauw, and to learn how to write a plugin with a configuration schema.
